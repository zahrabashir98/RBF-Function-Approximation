# RBF-Function-Approximation
##### Training an RBF(Radial Basis Function) Neural Network for function approximation.

Using this network and predict the F(x) = x^3 , then compare the output of the network with the results of the function F(x) and plot the comparison for the data in range of x âˆˆ [-2, 2]
